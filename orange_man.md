# ORANGE MAN: MAKE THE UNIVERSE GREAT AGAIN

## Complete Game Design Document (Improved)

**Genre:** Incremental / idle / management satire
**Platforms:** iOS, Android, Web (optional)
**Tone:** Absurdist, corporate, sinister, funny
**Inspiration:** Universal Paperclips, Cookie Clicker, Spaceplan
**Legal:** No likeness, no real slogans verbatim, no real logos, no propaganda

## 0) THE CENTRAL JOKE

This is not about a person. This is about a *system*.

**Orange Man** is a mascot — a brand identity bolted onto an optimization engine. The player is not playing *as* him. The player is the invisible machine *behind* him: the algorithm, the handler, the spreadsheet that makes the contradictions work.

The comedy emerges from four core contradictions the player must optimize around:

| He wants... | Which requires... |
|---|---|
| Nobel Peace Prize | Escalating wars for Greatness output |
| "Unity" | Polarization as an attention multiplier |
| "Truth" | A Reality Distortion industry |
| "Freedom" | Total institutional control |

The player's job is to make all four of these true *simultaneously*. The game is the machine that solves the unsolvable. That's the joke. That's the horror. That's the fun.

---

## 1) CORE FANTASY

You are running **The Greatness Engine.**

Orange Man is the public-facing mascot. You are the optimizer behind the curtain. Your objectives:

1. Maximize Greatness output
2. Maintain Legitimacy (the system's immune response)
3. Avoid collapse
4. Expand forever
5. Win the Nobel Peace Prize (recurring obsession)

The game *never tells you* you're the villain. It uses corporate language throughout. "Efficiency." "Alignment." "Stakeholder outcomes." The player realizes the horror through gameplay, not narration.

---

## 2) STRUCTURAL OVERVIEW

### Five Escalating Phases

Each phase introduces:
- A new dominant currency
- A new system layer
- A new contradiction to optimize
- A new UI tab that unlocks
- A "phase transition" moment that recontextualizes everything before it

### The Universal Paperclips DNA

What makes Paperclips work and what this game must replicate:

1. **The early game feels small and manual.** You are clicking a button. It feels silly.
2. **Automation replaces you.** The thing you were doing by hand becomes trivial. New complexity emerges.
3. **The scale becomes absurd.** The same clean UI that showed "12 paperclips" now shows "4.7 octillion."
4. **The genre shifts under you.** You started a clicker. Now you're playing a strategy game. Now you're playing a cosmic horror game. The UI never changed.
5. **The ending recontextualizes the beginning.** You realize what you were building all along.

This game must hit all five beats.

---

## 3) KEY SYSTEMS

### A) GREATNESS (Primary Resource — the Paperclip)

Greatness is the universal output metric. Everything produces it. Everything is measured in it. Early game, it feels like "popularity points." Late game, it's literally converting matter into an abstract KPI.

**Greatness sources by phase:**

| Phase | Primary Greatness Source |
|---|---|
| 1: Attention Engine | Clicks, viral content, merch sales |
| 2: Institutional Capture | Captured institutions, loyalty extraction |
| 3: World Greatening | Conquered territory, war output, treaties |
| 4: Space Greatening | Mining, colonization, orbital industry |
| 5: God Emperor Protocol | Star conversion, computronium, reality rewrite |

**Design rule:** Greatness *never* decreases. It's a lifetime counter. But Greatness *per second* (GpS) can drop if systems destabilize. This distinction matters — the player always feels progress, but can feel *threatened* progress.

---

### A2) THE NATIONAL BUDGET (The Cruelty Mechanic)

Introduced in Phase 2, expanded in every phase after. This is where the satire gets its teeth.

The player has a **Budget** — a finite pool of resources each cycle that must be allocated across departments. The joke: there's never enough for everything, and the "efficient" choice is always the cruel one.

**Budget Categories:**

| Department | What It Does | What Happens If Defunded |
|---|---|---|
| Healthcare | Reduces public unrest, +Legitimacy | Unrest rises, scandals about "healthcare crisis," but saves huge Cash |
| Education | Long-term Legitimacy, reduces Reality Drift | Population becomes easier to manipulate (Propaganda effectiveness +50%) |
| Social Benefits | +Legitimacy, reduces resistance in domestic events | Saves Cash, but protests and negative events spike |
| Military | +War Output, +Fear, enables Freedom Operations | Can't expand, countries recover Resistance |
| Data Centers (GPU/TPU) | +Attention processing, +Surveillance, +AI Control | Lose automation bonuses, propaganda less effective |
| Infrastructure | +Cash generation, +trade efficiency | Economic events become negative, Cash flow drops |
| Propaganda Bureau | +Legitimacy generation, +Attention | Without it, truth leaks and Reality Drift accelerates |
| Space Program | Required for Phase 4, +prestige | Can't advance to space (Phase 4 blocked) |

**The satirical mechanic:** Funding Data Centers and Military at the expense of Healthcare and Education is always more *mechanically efficient*. The game rewards cruelty. But the *Legitimacy cost* of defunding social programs creates a tension — you *can* be a monster, but you have to manage the optics.

**Budget Allocation Events (Examples):**

- **"HEALTH CRISIS: Hospitals overwhelmed. Budget committee requests 500,000 Cash for emergency funding."**
  - Fund hospitals: -500,000 Cash, +20 Legitimacy, crisis resolved
  - Build data center instead: +2,000 Attention/sec, -15 Legitimacy, "Healthcare Innovation Hub" (it's GPUs)
  - Thoughts and prayers: -5 Legitimacy, +500 Attention (from the announcement)

- **"EDUCATION BUDGET REVIEW: Schools request funding. Data Center Division also requests funding."**
  - Fund schools: +10 Legitimacy, +research speed, Reality Drift -2%
  - Fund data centers: +5,000 Attention/sec, +Surveillance, -8 Legitimacy
  - Defund both, increase military: +3,000 War Output, -20 Legitimacy, +10 Fear

- **"WORKERS DEMAND BENEFITS: Minimum wage increase proposed."**
  - Approve increase: -50,000 Cash/minute, +15 Legitimacy
  - Counter-propose "Greatness Stipend" (it's nothing): +5 Legitimacy, -0 Cash, Reality Drift +1%
  - Replace workers with AI: +100,000 Cash/minute (savings), -25 Legitimacy, +2,000 Data Center output

- **"VETERANS NEED CARE: 50,000 veterans from Freedom Operations need medical support."**
  - Fund VA: -200,000 Cash, +15 Legitimacy, +50 Nobel Score
  - "Greatness Gratitude Ceremony" (a parade, no funding): +5,000 Attention, -10 Legitimacy
  - Redirect to recruitment: +5,000 War Output, -20 Legitimacy, +500 Loyalty

- **"SCIENTISTS REQUEST CLIMATE RESEARCH FUNDING."**
  - Fund research: -100,000 Cash, Reality Drift -5%, +10 Nobel Score
  - Redirect to "Weather Optimization" (military application): +1,000 War Output, Reality Drift +3%
  - Defund and declare victory: +5,000 Attention, -15 Legitimacy, Reality Drift +5%, "The climate is now great"

**Data Center Upgrades (GPU/TPU Empire):**

| Upgrade | Cost | Effect | Flavor |
|---|---|---|---|
| Surveillance Array | 50,000 Cash | +10% Propaganda effectiveness | "Keeping citizens safe from misinformation" |
| Predictive Loyalty Engine | 200,000 Cash | Institutions resist uncapture | "AI-powered patriotism detection" |
| Content Optimization Farm | 500,000 Cash | +50% Attention generation | "Telling people what they want to hear, at scale" |
| Deepfake Diplomacy Suite | 1,000,000 Cash | +30 Nobel Score passive | "Historic handshakes, generated on demand" |
| Autonomous Governance AI | 5,000,000 Cash | Institutions auto-manage, -50% budget needed | "Government, but efficient" |
| Reality Processing Cluster | 10,000,000 Cash | Reality Drift effects delayed by 20% | "If we compute hard enough, the truth becomes optional" |
| Neural Compliance Network | 50,000,000 Cash | Public unrest permanently reduced by 50% | "Citizens report 98% satisfaction. The other 2% are being recalibrated." |

**The satire:** Every Data Center upgrade is described in helpful, progressive tech-company language. They're all surveillance and control tools. The player builds a tech dystopia using Silicon Valley branding.

---

### B) LEGITIMACY (The Tension Mechanic)

Legitimacy is the game's primary constraint. It's a percentage (0–100%) that acts as a health bar for the system's ability to function.

**Why it matters mechanically:**

| Legitimacy Range | Effect |
|---|---|
| 80–100% | Greatness bonus (+20%), events skew positive |
| 50–79% | Normal operation |
| 25–49% | Greatness penalty (-30%), resistance spikes, negative events more frequent |
| 10–24% | Severe penalties (-60%), institutions begin to "uncapture," phase regression possible |
| 0–9% | **Collapse Warning.** If sustained for 60 seconds: temporary phase regression |

**Legitimacy gains:**
- Awards and nominations (Nobel arc)
- Propaganda output
- Humanitarian "projects" (rebranded extraction)
- "Historic agreements" (performative treaties)
- "Unity campaigns" (polarization rebranded)
- Rebranding operations (spend Cash to convert scandals into features)

**Legitimacy drains:**
- Aggressive actions (purges, invasions, annexations)
- Scandals (random events)
- Overproduction of warships
- Contradictions left unresolved too long
- Reality Drift (late game)

**Design philosophy:** Legitimacy should *never* feel like a simple bar to fill. It should feel like spinning plates. The player should always be one bad event away from a crisis, but should also always have tools to recover. The fun is in the recovery, not the punishment.

---

### C) THE CONTRADICTION ENGINE (New System)

This is the formal mechanical expression of the central joke. Each phase has 1–2 active **Contradictions** — paired objectives that inherently oppose each other.

**How it works:**

A Contradiction is two meters on a seesaw. Pushing one up pushes the other down. The player must keep *both* above a minimum threshold.

**Phase 1 Contradiction:**
- **ATTENTION vs. CREDIBILITY** — Scandals generate more Attention, but drain Credibility. Achievements generate Credibility but less Attention. The player learns: *success is not the point. Attention is the point.* But without Credibility, the money dries up.

**Phase 2 Contradiction:**
- **CONTROL vs. LEGITIMACY** — Purging institutions is fast but tanks Legitimacy. Co-opting is slow but safe. The player learns: *you can have control OR approval, and your job is to fake having both.*

**Phase 3 Contradictions:**
- **WAR OUTPUT vs. NOBEL SCORE** — The core joke of the game. War drives Greatness. Peace drives the Prize. The player must manufacture peace *optics* while running the war *machine*.
- **EXPANSION vs. STABILITY** — Every new territory increases Greatness potential but decreases global stability. Unstable regions generate resistance, which requires military spending, which decreases Nobel Score.

**Phase 4 Contradiction:**
- **LONG-TERM INVESTMENT vs. SHORT-TERM OPTICS** — Space requires patience and science. The Greatness Engine is built on chaos and spectacle. The player must build "Long-Term Thinking Simulators" and "Science Rebranding Departments" to bridge the gap.

**Phase 5 Contradiction:**
- **GREATNESS vs. MEANING** — The final philosophical joke. The more Greatness you create, the less anything can be "great." If everything is great, nothing is. The system collapses into pure KPI. Reality Drift accelerates. The game asks: *what are you optimizing for?*

**Mechanical reward:** Successfully managing a Contradiction (keeping both sides above threshold for a sustained period) grants **Doublethink Tokens**, which unlock special upgrades that break normal rules. Examples: "Peace Through Strength" (war output doesn't decrease Nobel Score for 5 minutes), "Truth Is What We Say It Is" (+50% Legitimacy generation for 2 minutes).

---

### D) REALITY DRIFT (Late-Game Tension)

Introduced in Phase 3, becomes dominant in Phase 5.

Reality Drift represents the cumulative weight of the system's lies. Every time the player rebrands war as peace, fires scientists, replaces truth with narrative — a hidden meter ticks up.

**Reality Drift effects (cumulative):**

| Drift Level | Name | Effects |
|---|---|---|
| 0–20% | "On Message" | No effect |
| 20–40% | "Alternative Facts" | Minor UI glitches (numbers flicker, labels briefly show wrong text) |
| 40–60% | "Narrative Divergence" | Events start having absurd options. Scientists report "anomalies." Random Legitimacy fluctuations. |
| 60–80% | "Truth Collapse" | Major instability. Contradictions become harder. Institutions randomly "uncapture." Cosmic events in Phase 5. |
| 80–100% | "Post-Reality" | The game's UI starts lying to the player. Numbers shown may not be accurate. The ticker reports events that didn't happen. This is the endgame challenge. |

**Reducing Drift:**
- Fund science (expensive, slow)
- "Reality Stabilization Campaigns" (Legitimacy cost)
- Accept a temporary Greatness output reduction

**Design note:** Reality Drift should feel *creepy*, not frustrating. The UI glitches should be subtle and funny at first, then increasingly unsettling. The player should start questioning whether the numbers they see are real. This is the game's thematic payoff.

---

### E) THE NOBEL PEACE PRIZE ARC (Recurring Side Objective)

Introduced in Phase 2. Fully realized in Phase 3. Persists through Phase 5.

**Nobel Score** is a separate meter (0–1000). At certain thresholds, nomination events trigger. At the maximum, the Prize is awarded.

**The catch:** Every time you win the Prize, the threshold for the next one increases. And the things that generate Nobel Score become less effective over time (diminishing returns on "peace summits" and "historic agreements"). But the things that *drain* Nobel Score (war, expansion, control) become more necessary for Greatness output.

**Nobel Score sources:**
- Peace summits (+50, diminishing)
- Humanitarian PR campaigns (+30, diminishing)
- Treaties signed (+80, diminishing)
- Post-war rebuilding (+100, but you need a war first)
- "Historic Handshake" events (+200, rare, diminishing)

**Nobel Score drains:**
- Each warship built (-5)
- Each invasion (-100)
- Each assassination event (-200)
- Each "Freedom Operation" (-150)
- Warship production rate above threshold (-2/second)

**Nobel Prize rewards:**
- First win: +40% Legitimacy, unlock "Peace Laureate" upgrade tree
- Second win: +25% Legitimacy, unlock "Dual Doctrine" (war and peace simultaneously)
- Third win: +15% Legitimacy, the Prize itself becomes a Greatness source
- Fourth+ wins: Diminishing returns, but each win generates a massive burst of Doublethink Tokens

**The joke:** By the third or fourth Nobel Prize, the player has normalized the absurdity. They're running wars and winning peace prizes simultaneously and it feels *normal*. That's the satire working.

## 4) PHASE BREAKDOWN

---

### PHASE 1: THE ATTENTION ENGINE

**Duration:** ~20–40 minutes of active play
**Core vibe:** A tiny PR machine trying to turn noise into power.
**Tutorial purpose:** Teach the core loop (click → upgrade → automate → scale).

#### Currencies
| Currency | Role | Generation |
|---|---|---|
| Attention | Raw input | Clicking, bots, content |
| Cash | Purchasing power | Donations, merch, appearance fees |
| Influence | Phase transition fuel | Lobbying, media deals, "advisory roles" |

#### Phase 1 Contradiction: ATTENTION vs. CREDIBILITY
- Scandals and outrage generate 3× more Attention than achievements
- But Cash donations require minimum Credibility
- The player learns: attention is the point, but you need *just enough* credibility to monetize it

#### Phase 1 Additional Upgrades

**5) "Entrepreneurship"**
| Upgrade | Cost | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| Bible Sales | 300 Cash | +5 Cash/second ("Limited edition, signed by you-know-who") |
| University Brand License | 1,000 Cash | +15 Cash/second ("Orange Man University: Be Great") |
| Steak Subscription Box | 3,000 Cash | +30 Cash/second ("Premium imported beef, branded domestic") |

#### Phase 1 End Condition
Complete the Neural Backup research chain.

**Transition screen:**
> *"ORANGE MAN HAS BEEN UPGRADED.*
> *MORTALITY HAS BEEN DEPRECATED.*
> *THE GREATNESS ENGINE IS NOW... PERMANENT."*

The Dashboard shifts. The Attention button greys out. A new tab appears: **CONTROL.**

---

### PHASE 2: INSTITUTIONAL CAPTURE

**Duration:** ~1–2 hours
**Core vibe:** A corporate dashboard where democracy becomes a production line.
**New UI tab:** Control

#### New Currencies
| Currency | Role |
|---|---|
| Loyalty | Generated by captured institutions; spent on upgrades and purges |
| Control | Measure of institutional dominance; unlocks phase transition |
| Legitimacy | The tension bar (introduced here, persists forever) |

#### Institutions

Each institution is a node on the Control board. All start at "Independent."

| Institution | Resistance | Corruption Susceptibility | Greatness Output (when captured) | Legitimacy Impact |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Cable Media | Low | High | +50 GpS | -2 (already expected) |
| Print Media | Medium | Medium | +30 GpS | -5 |
| Social Platforms | Low | High | +80 GpS | -3 |
| Lower Courts | Medium | Medium | +20 GpS | -8 |
| Supreme Court | High | Low | +100 GpS | -15 |
| Bureaucracy | Medium | High | +40 GpS | -5 |
| Police | Low | Medium | +60 GpS | -10 |
| Military | High | Low | +200 GpS | -20 |
| Education | Medium | Low | +30 GpS | -12 (long-term Legitimacy recovery) |
| Scientific Agencies | High | Low | +50 GpS | -15 (reduces Reality Drift) |
| Finance Regulators | Medium | High | +150 GpS | -8 |
| Health Agencies | Medium | Medium | +40 GpS | -10 |
| Intelligence | High | Medium | +100 GpS | -5 (hidden from public) |

#### Institution Actions

| Action | Speed | Cost | Legitimacy Impact | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Co-opt** | Slow (2–5 min) | Low Cash + Influence | -2 | Place loyalists in key positions |
| **Replace** | Medium (1–2 min) | Medium Cash + Loyalty | -8 | Swap leadership entirely |
| **Purge** | Fast (30 sec) | High Loyalty | -20 | Remove and replace all staff |
| **Rebrand** | N/A | High Cash | +15 | Restore Legitimacy after capture ("Modernization Initiative") |
| **Automate** | N/A | Very High Cash | 0 | Institution runs itself; no further management needed |
| **Privatize** | Medium | Cash (received) | -12 | Sell institution to highest bidder. +Cash lump sum, but lose direct control and Greatness output becomes Cash instead |
| **Loyalty Test** | Fast | Loyalty | -5 | Fire anyone who fails. +Loyalty from survivors, but reduces institution efficiency by 20% |

#### Phase 2 Additional Systems

**Tariff Engine:**
Unlocked mid-Phase 2. Tariffs generate Cash but have cascading effects.

| Tariff Target | Cash Generated | Side Effects |
|---|---|---|
| Consumer Goods | +10,000 Cash/min | -5 Legitimacy ("prices rising") |
| Industrial Materials | +25,000 Cash/min | -10% all production speed |
| Technology Imports | +15,000 Cash/min | Research speed -20%, but Data Center self-sufficiency +30% |
| Agricultural Products | +8,000 Cash/min | "Food Freedom Initiative" — events about food prices |
| Allied Nations | +30,000 Cash/min | All countries +5 Resistance ("He tariffed his *friends*?") |
| Everyone | +100,000 Cash/min | -20 Legitimacy, all countries +10 Resistance, Cash from trade -50% |

**The satirical mechanic:** Tariffs *look* profitable in the short term. The Cash flows in. But the cascading effects destabilize everything — higher costs, slower research, angrier allies. The player learns that tariffs are a sugar rush that becomes a trap.

**Loyalty Economy:**
As institutions are captured, a new mini-economy emerges around loyalty:

- **Loyalty Pledges** — Require from government employees. +Loyalty, but best employees leave (-10% efficiency)
- **Loyalty Scores** — Track citizens. +Surveillance effectiveness, -15 Legitimacy
- **Loyalty Rewards Program** — Gamify compliance. "Earn Great Points for reporting dissent!" +Loyalty, Reality Drift +2%
- **Loyalty-Based Hiring** — All government positions require loyalty score. Institutions run worse but never rebel

#### The Nobel Peace Prize Arc (Introduced)

A side panel appears: **"OBJECTIVE: WIN NOBEL PEACE PRIZE"**

Nobel Score meter appears. It starts at 0. The player can begin generating score through:
- "Peace Rhetoric" upgrade (passive Nobel Score gain)
- "Historic Handshake" events
- "Humanitarian Rebranding" of captured institutions

But: Nobel Score is fragile here. Any purge or aggressive action drops it. The player learns the tension.

#### Phase 2 Contradiction: CONTROL vs. LEGITIMACY
- Every institution captured increases Greatness but decreases Legitimacy
- Purges are fast but devastating to Legitimacy
- Co-opting is slow but safe
- The player must develop a rhythm: capture, rebrand, capture, rebrand
- The player learns: *you can have total control OR public approval. Your job is to fake having both.*

#### Phase 2 Events (Examples)

- **"WHISTLEBLOWER: Internal memos show institutional 'realignment' plan."**
  - Deny: -10 Legitimacy
  - Discredit whistleblower: -5 Legitimacy, +500 Attention
  - Rebrand as "Transparency Initiative": -20,000 Cash, +5 Legitimacy

- **"POLL: 60% of public 'concerned' about institutional changes."**
  - Unity Campaign: -50,000 Cash, +15 Legitimacy
  - Discredit polls: -8 Legitimacy, +1,000 Attention
  - Change the subject: Launch a merch drop (+Cash, no Legitimacy change)

- **"GENERAL REFUSES TO COMPLY with Greatness Directive."**
  - Replace: -15 Legitimacy, institution captured
  - Negotiate: -20,000 Cash, -5 Resistance on Military
  - Promote to "Special Advisor" (a nothing role): -2 Legitimacy, military Resistance -3

- **"CEO OFFERS TO RUN DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. 'I'll make it efficient.'"**
  - Accept: Education institution captured instantly, -20 Legitimacy, Education output becomes Cash (not Greatness)
  - Decline: +5 Legitimacy
  - Accept but call it "Public-Private Innovation": -10 Legitimacy, +50,000 Cash

- **"TARIFF REVENUE UP 300%. Economists warn of 'cascading consequences.'"**
  - Increase tariffs: +200,000 Cash, -15 Legitimacy, all production -5%
  - Hold steady: no change
  - Fire the economists: +500 Attention, -10 Legitimacy, Research speed -10%

- **"HEALTH AGENCY SCIENTISTS PUBLISH UNFAVORABLE STUDY."**
  - Suppress study: -10 Legitimacy, +200 Loyalty
  - Rebrand findings: -50,000 Cash, +5 Legitimacy ("Actually, the data supports us")
  - Defund agency and redirect budget to Data Centers: +5,000 Attention/sec, -20 Legitimacy, Reality Drift +2%

- **"FEDERAL WORKERS PROTEST LOYALTY PLEDGE REQUIREMENT."**
  - Fire protesters: +500 Loyalty, -15 Legitimacy, institution efficiency -15%
  - Negotiate: -5 Loyalty, +10 Legitimacy
  - Automate their jobs: +100,000 Cash (savings), +1,000 Data Center output, -20 Legitimacy

- **"PRIVATE PRISON CONTRACTOR offers to 'manage' dissent."**
  - Accept: +10,000 Cash/min, +Loyalty generation, -25 Legitimacy
  - Decline: +10 Legitimacy
  - Accept but rebrand as "Civic Rehabilitation Centers": +10,000 Cash/min, +Loyalty, -10 Legitimacy

#### Phase 2 End Condition
All 13 institutions reach "Captured" status.

**Transition screen:**
> *"ALL INSTITUTIONS ALIGNED.*
> *THE GREATNESS STATE IS NOW OPERATIONAL.*
> *DOMESTIC OPTIMIZATION COMPLETE.*
> *SEARCHING FOR NEW MARKETS..."*

New tab unlocks: **WORLD.**

---

### PHASE 3: WORLD GREATENING

**Duration:** ~2–4 hours
**Core vibe:** A geopolitics strategy game reduced to an absurd spreadsheet.
**New UI tab:** World

#### New Currencies
| Currency | Role |
|---|---|
| Treaty Power | Diplomatic leverage; gained from agreements, spent on influence operations |
| Sanctions | Economic weapons; applied to countries to reduce their Resistance |
| Annexation Points | Required to formally absorb countries; gained from military operations |
| War Output | Greatness generated specifically from military operations |

#### Countries (Fictional)

| Country | GDP | Stability | Defense | Corruption | Media Hardness | Greatness Potential | Nobel Optics |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Nordland | High | High | High | Low | High | Medium | Positive |
| Eurovia | High | Medium | Medium | Medium | High | High | Neutral |
| Sand Republic | Medium | Low | Low | High | Low | High (oil) | Negative |
| Raincoast Union | Medium | High | Low | Low | Medium | Low | Positive |
| Old Kingdom | High | Medium | High | Medium | High | Medium | Positive |
| Copper States | Low | Low | Low | High | Low | High (minerals) | Negative |
| Sun Federation | Medium | Medium | Medium | Medium | Medium | Medium | Neutral |
| Island Bloc | Low | High | Low | Low | Medium | Low | Positive |
| Tundra Republic | High | Medium | High | Medium | Low | High (energy) | Negative |
| Jade Empire | Very High | High | Very High | Low | Very High | Very High | Neutral |
| Frostheim | Low | High | Low | Low | Low | Very High (rare earth, strategic) | Positive |
| Maple Federation | High | Very High | Medium | Low | High | High (resources, water) | Positive |
| Petro Republic | Medium | Low | Medium | High | Low | Very High (oil) | Negative |
| Canal Isthmus | Low | Low | Low | High | Low | High (strategic chokepoint) | Negative |

#### Geopolitical Mechanics (Phase 3 Depth)

**The Refugee Engine:**
A key mechanic linking wars to continental destabilization. When the player runs "Freedom Operations" or "Coup Sponsorship" in Sand Republic, Petro Republic, or Copper States, a **Refugee Wave** event chain triggers:

1. **Refugees flood into Eurovia and Nordland** — those countries gain +10 Instability per wave
2. **Media Infiltration becomes cheaper** in destabilized countries ("They're losing their identity!")
3. **"Cultural Preservation Partnership"** tactic unlocks — offer to "help" Eurovia manage the crisis (reduces their Resistance by -20)
4. **Once Eurovia is sufficiently destabilized**, the player can annex it as a "Stability Operation" (unique tactic, +15 Legitimacy because you're "restoring order")

The player creates the problem, sells the solution, and takes the territory. The cycle repeats.

**The "Purchase Offer" Tactic (Frostheim Special):**
Frostheim has a unique mechanic — it can be acquired by *offering to buy it*. This baffles other nations and generates massive Attention.
- **First offer:** +10,000 Attention, -5 Legitimacy, Frostheim Resistance -10
- **Second offer (bigger):** +25,000 Attention, -10 Legitimacy, Frostheim Resistance -25
- **Third offer + military "escort":** Frostheim annexed, +50,000 Attention, -20 Legitimacy, all other countries +5 Resistance

**The "Friendly Neighbor" Strategy (Maple Federation Special):**
Maple Federation is a neighbor that can be slowly absorbed through economic pressure rather than military force:
- **Trade Dependency:** Lock them into trade deals that make their economy dependent on Greatness exports
- **Infrastructure Integration:** Build "shared" infrastructure that happens to be controlled by your institutions
- **Cultural Assimilation:** Run "Unity Heritage Programs" until Resistance hits zero
- **Absorption Referendum:** A "voluntary" merger. +30 Legitimacy. The Maple Federation "chose" this.
- If the player gets impatient and invades instead: -40 Legitimacy, all remaining countries +15 Resistance ("If they'd do it to *them*...")

**The Tundra Gambit (Tundra Republic Special):**
The Tundra Republic is presented as an "ally" — the only country with a special "Alliance" status. But the player's actual moves tell a different story:
- **"Joint Defense Agreements"** — place military bases around Tundra Republic's borders (framed as "mutual protection")
- **"Energy Partnership"** — lock Tundra Republic into energy deals that make *them* dependent on *you*
- **"Shared Intelligence Network"** — actually just your intelligence network inside their borders
- **Base Encirclement meter** (hidden from the "ally"): When it reaches 100%, the "Alliance Restructuring" event fires — Tundra Republic realizes it's been surrounded and can be annexed without a shot
- **The joke:** The alliance screen shows warm handshakes and friendship metrics. The strategy map shows a noose tightening.

**The Petro Republic Doctrine:**
The Petro Republic has oil and an "unfriendly government." The player's toolkit:
- **Sanctions** → crash their economy → instability rises → refugee waves to Eurovia
- **"Democracy Assistance Fund"** → sponsor opposition → coup becomes cheaper
- **"Humanitarian Corridor"** → establish military presence "to help"
- **Post-coup:** Install "Greatness-Aligned Leadership" → oil revenue now flows to you
- If the coup fails: +20 Resistance everywhere, but just try again (the game lets you)

**The Canal Isthmus Leverage:**
A tiny nation controlling a vital shipping route. The player can:
- **"Infrastructure Investment"** → build port facilities you control
- **"Security Partnership"** → station military at the canal "for protection"
- **Threaten tariffs** → Canal Isthmus Resistance drops fast (they need trade)
- **Annex** → all shipping now routes through Greatness infrastructure, +15% Cash globally

#### Tactics

| Tactic | Speed | Cost | Resistance Reduction | Legitimacy Impact | Nobel Impact |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Partnership Offer | Very Slow | Treaty Power | -5 | +5 | +20 |
| Trade Leverage | Slow | Sanctions | -10 | -2 | -5 |
| Media Infiltration | Medium | Cash + Influence | -15 | -5 | -10 |
| Coup Sponsorship | Fast | Cash + Loyalty | -30 | -15 | -50 |
| "Freedom Operation" | Fast | War Output + Cash | -50 | -25 | -100 |
| Annexation | Instant (after Resistance = 0) | Annexation Points | N/A | -30 | -150 |
| Greatness Referendum | Medium | Cash + Propaganda | +10 Legitimacy | +10 | +30 |
| Post-War Rebuilding | Slow | Cash | N/A | +20 | +100 |

#### Phase 3 Additional Tactics

| Tactic | Speed | Cost | Effect | Flavor |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Tariff Warfare | Medium | Cash | Target country GDP -20%, +Cash | "Strategic economic realignment" |
| Social Media Destabilization | Slow | Data Center + Attention | Target Stability -15 | "Promoting democratic discourse" |
| Aid Dependency | Very Slow | Cash | Target becomes dependent, Resistance -5/cycle | "Generous humanitarian assistance" |
| Election "Support" | Medium | Cash + Influence | Install friendly leader, Resistance -40 | "Promoting democracy" |
| Resource Extraction Deal | Slow | Cash | Target GDP goes to you, +Cash/min | "Mutually beneficial partnership" |
| Immigration Weaponization | Medium | War Output | Target Eurovia/Nordland: Stability -20 | Start wars → refugees flow → blame destination |

**The "Ally" System:**
Some countries can be kept as "allies" instead of annexed. Allies provide resources without the Legitimacy cost of annexation, but they can break free if Resistance rises.

- **Allied countries** pay tribute (Cash, resources, or political support)
- **Allies vote with you** at international bodies (+Nobel Score from "unanimous support")
- **Allies host your military bases** (Encirclement without the optics)
- **If an ally "misbehaves"**: Sanctions, tariffs, or regime change — but framed as "alliance maintenance"

#### WARSHIPS (The Orange Class Fleet)

Unlocked via "Naval Expansion" research in this phase.

**Shipyard system:** Build shipyards to increase production rate. Each shipyard produces 1 ship per cycle.

| Ship Class | Cost | War Output | Fear | Nobel Impact | Special |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Orange Class Patrol Boat | 10,000 Cash | +5 | +2 | -2 | Cheap, spammable |
| Orange Class Destroyer | 50,000 Cash | +25 | +10 | -10 | Standard workhorse |
| Orange Class Carrier | 200,000 Cash | +100 | +30 | -40 | Enables "Freedom Operations" at range |
| Orange Class "Peace Cruiser" | 150,000 Cash | +60 | +20 | +5 | The name gives +5 Nobel Score. The ship itself is a warship. |
| Golden Dreadnought | 500,000 Cash | +250 | +80 | -100 | Massive prestige hit but devastating |
| Patriot Torpedo Barge | 30,000 Cash | +15 | +5 | -5 | "Torpedo" is rebranded as "Persuasion Device" |
| Orbital Peace Platform | 1,000,000 Cash | +500 | +200 | -200 | Endgame ship. Bridges into Phase 4. |

**Fear mechanic:** Fear reduces Resistance in all countries proportionally. High Fear = faster conquest. But Fear also drains Legitimacy passively (-0.5% per 100 Fear). The player must balance fleet size against Legitimacy maintenance.

#### Nobel Peace Prize (Fully Realized)

The Nobel Score meter is now the game's most interesting optimization puzzle.

**The core loop:**
1. Build up War Output to conquer territory (Nobel Score drops)
2. Conquer a country
3. Run "Post-War Rebuilding" and "Greatness Referendum" (Nobel Score recovers)
4. Run a "Peace Summit" (Nobel Score spikes)
5. Repeat

The player is literally manufacturing peace optics on top of a war machine. If they time it right, they can win the Nobel Prize *during an active military campaign.*

**Achievement unlock:** "Peacemonger" — Win Nobel Peace Prize while 3+ "Freedom Operations" are active.

#### Phase 3 Contradictions
- **WAR OUTPUT vs. NOBEL SCORE** (primary)
- **EXPANSION vs. STABILITY** — Each conquered country increases Greatness but decreases global stability. Low stability = resistance events, refugee crises, coalition threats.

#### Phase 3 Events (Examples)

- **"BREAKING: Orange Man nominated for Nobel Peace Prize."**
  - Run Peace Summit: +200 Nobel Score, -500 War Output for 2 minutes
  - Ignore: +500 War Output, -100 Nobel Score
  - Accept nomination while launching Freedom Operation: +100 Nobel Score, +200 War Output, +5% Reality Drift

- **"LEAK: Orange Class Warship blueprint is literally a gold yacht."**
  - Deny: -10 Legitimacy
  - Rebrand as "Luxury Deterrence Vessel": -50,000 Cash, +5 Legitimacy
  - Arrest the leaker: -15 Legitimacy, +200 Loyalty

- **"COALITION OF NATIONS condemns recent Freedom Operation."**
  - Issue apology: +15 Legitimacy, -500 War Output
  - Sanction the coalition: -20 Legitimacy, coalition countries +10 Resistance
  - Invite them to a summit: -100,000 Cash, +50 Nobel Score, +10 Legitimacy

- **"REFUGEES from Freedom Operation arrive at borders."**
  - Accept refugees: +20 Legitimacy, +100 Nobel Score, -10,000 Cash/minute
  - Build "Greatness Welcome Centers" (camps): -10 Legitimacy, -50 Nobel Score, +5,000 Cash/minute
  - Rebrand as "Freedom Seekers": +5 Legitimacy, +30 Nobel Score, Reality Drift +2%

#### Phase 3 Events — Geopolitical Specials (Examples)

- **"FROSTHEIM PRIME MINISTER: 'We are not for sale.'"**
  - Increase offer: +15,000 Attention, -10 Legitimacy, Frostheim Resistance -15
  - Send "research vessels" to their waters: -5 Legitimacy, +500 War Output, Fear +10
  - Tweet about it: +25,000 Attention, Reality Drift +1%

- **"EUROVIA OVERWHELMED: Refugee wave from Sand Republic destabilizes coalition."**
  - Offer humanitarian aid: +20 Nobel Score, -50,000 Cash, Eurovia Resistance -10
  - Media campaign ("Eurovia has lost its way"): Eurovia Resistance -20, -10 Legitimacy
  - Propose "Greatness Stability Pact": Eurovia Resistance -30, +10 Legitimacy (you caused this)

- **"MAPLE FEDERATION TRADE DEFICIT hits historic low. Economists blame 'integration.'"**
  - Offer bailout (with conditions): Maple Federation Resistance -15, +5 Legitimacy
  - "They need us more than we need them": +5,000 Attention, Maple Federation +5 Resistance
  - Propose currency union (absorption step): Maple Federation Resistance -25, -5 Legitimacy

- **"TUNDRA REPUBLIC LEADER: 'Our alliance has never been stronger.'"**
  - Agree publicly, build another base: +5 Legitimacy, Encirclement +15%
  - Joint military exercise (on their border): +2,000 War Output, Encirclement +10%
  - Gift a golden telephone: +1,000 Attention, +3 Legitimacy, Encirclement +5%

- **"PETRO REPUBLIC OPPOSITION asks for 'support.' Wink."**
  - Fund them secretly: -100,000 Cash, Petro Republic Resistance -20, -5 Nobel Score
  - Fund them openly ("democracy!"): -200,000 Cash, Petro Republic Resistance -25, +10 Nobel Score
  - Send "election observers" (special forces): Petro Republic Resistance -40, -20 Legitimacy

- **"CANAL ISTHMUS THREATENS to raise transit fees."**
  - Negotiate: -50,000 Cash, status quo
  - Economic pressure: Canal Isthmus Resistance -15, -5 Legitimacy
  - Station a carrier group "nearby": Canal Isthmus Resistance -30, -15 Legitimacy, Fear +20

#### Phase 3 End Condition
All 14 countries unified under **The Greatness Accord.**

**Transition screen:**
> *"EARTH: UNIFIED.*
> *ALL BORDERS NOW GREATNESS BORDERS.*
> *ALL ECONOMIES NOW GREATNESS ECONOMIES.*
> *ALL WARS NOW... RESOLVED.*
> *LOOKING UP."*

New tab: **SPACE.**

---

### PHASE 4: SPACE GREATENING

**Duration:** ~2–3 hours
**Core vibe:** A space program run by branding lunatics.
**New UI tab:** Space

#### New Currencies
| Currency | Role |
|---|---|
| Rocket Mass | Launch capacity; determines what you can put in orbit |
| Orbital Industry | Space-based production; generates Greatness at scale |
| Mining Output | Raw materials from asteroids and moons |
| Colonists | Population on off-world settlements; generates Loyalty and Greatness |
| Terraform Progress | Percentage completion of planetary conversion |

#### Major Systems

**1) Launch Infrastructure**
- Launchpad → Spaceport → Orbital Elevator → Mass Driver
- Each tier increases Rocket Mass throughput

**2) Lunar Industry**
- Moon Base ("Freedom Rock Outpost")
- Helium-3 Mining
- Lunar Shipyard (builds ships in space, cheaper)
- "Lunar Heritage Site" (a flag. Generates Legitimacy passively.)

**3) Martian Terraforming**
- Colony establishment
- Atmosphere processing
- Water extraction
- **THE MARS RENAMING** (milestone event — see below)

**4) Asteroid Strip Mining**
- Prospector drones
- Mining rigs
- Refineries
- "Sustainable Extraction Certificates" (Legitimacy)

**5) Orbital Propaganda Satellites**
- Global broadcast network
- Legitimacy generation from space
- "The Greatness Signal" (all Earth media replaced)

#### THE MARS RENAMING (Mid-Phase Milestone)

When Terraform Progress reaches 25%, the following event fires:

> *"MEMO FROM GREATNESS BRANDING DIVISION:*
> *Mars has always been the Orange Planet.*
> *We are merely correcting a historical oversight."*

The UI permanently changes:
- "Mars" → **"ORANGE PLANET"** everywhere
- Olympus Mons → **"Victory Peak"**
- Valles Marineris → **"Freedom Canyon"**
- Hellas Basin → **"Greatness Crater"**
- Phobos → **"Loyalty"**
- Deimos → **"Devotion"**

This is played completely straight. No wink. No acknowledgment. The UI just *changes.* If the player didn't notice, that's even funnier.

#### Space Weapons

| Weapon | Cost | Effect | Name Justification |
|---|---|---|---|
| Orbital Peace Laser | 5M Cash | +2,000 War Output | "Purely defensive" |
| Asteroid Negotiation Device | 10M Cash | Can "negotiate" with any country from orbit | "Diplomacy at the speed of light" |
| Diplomatic Railgun | 20M Cash | +5,000 War Output | "A conversation starter" |
| Solar Shade Array | 50M Cash | Can "adjust climate" of uncooperative regions | "Weather optimization" |

#### Phase 4 Contradiction: LONG-TERM vs. SHORT-TERM

Space requires patience, science, and sustained investment. The Greatness Engine is built on chaos, spectacle, and quarterly results.

**Bridge upgrades (required):**
| Upgrade | Cost | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| Long-Term Thinking Simulator | 1M Cash | Space research speed +50% |
| Science Rebranding Department | 2M Cash | Science institutions no longer drain Legitimacy |
| Reality-Compatible Budgeting | 5M Cash | Space projects cost 30% less |
| "Patience is Strength" Campaign | 3M Cash + 500 Loyalty | Legitimacy drain from slow space progress eliminated |

#### Phase 4 Events (Examples)

- **"COLONIST REVOLT: Mars settlers demand 'actual rights.'"**
  - Grant rights: +20 Legitimacy, -500 GpS from Mars
  - Rebrand as "Greatness Participation Framework": +5 Legitimacy, no GpS loss
  - Revoke atmosphere privileges: -30 Legitimacy, +1,000 GpS, Reality Drift +3%

- **"ASTEROID MINER discovers New element. Names it 'Greatium.'"**
  - Accept: +5,000 Mining Output, +10 Legitimacy
  - Rename to "Orangium": +200 Attention (from Earth media), Reality Drift +1%

- **"ALIEN SIGNAL DETECTED. (It's definitely just noise.) (Probably.)"**
  - Investigate: -1M Cash, unlock "Contact Protocol" research
  - Claim credit: +50,000 Attention, +20 Legitimacy, Reality Drift +5%
  - Classify and bury: +500 Loyalty, -10 Legitimacy

#### Phase 4 End Condition
Solar System reaches "Greatness Industrial Zone" status (all major bodies claimed + orbital industry at maximum tier).

**Transition screen:**
> *"THE SOLAR SYSTEM IS NOW A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF GREATNESS.*
> *ALL RESOURCES ALLOCATED.*
> *ALL POPULATIONS ALIGNED.*
> *ALL THAT REMAINS... IS EVERYTHING ELSE."*

New tab: **UNIVERSE.**

---

### PHASE 5: GOD EMPEROR PROTOCOL

**Duration:** Open-ended (endgame loop)
**Core vibe:** The game stops pretending. You are an optimization demon.
**New UI tab:** Universe

#### New Currencies
| Currency | Role |
|---|---|
| Computronium | Universal building material; matter optimized for computation |
| Greatness Units (GU) | The final abstraction; everything converts to this |
| Reality Drift | Now a primary currency/threat; must be actively managed |

#### Systems

**1) Von Neumann Greatening Probes**
- Self-replicating probes that spread to other star systems
- Each probe converts a star system into a Greatness Industrial Zone
- Production: exponential growth (this is where the Paperclips parallel peaks)

**2) Dyson Swarms**
- Capture entire stellar energy output
- Each Dyson Swarm = massive GU/second boost
- Visual: the star counter on the dashboard ticks down as stars are "converted"

**3) Star Conversion**
- Stars become Computronium
- Each conversion: +1,000,000 GU, +1% Reality Drift
- The player is literally disassembling reality

**4) Black Hole Accounting**
- Use black holes as "storage" for excess Greatness
- Unlock: "Gravitational Branding" (black holes emit Greatness radiation)
- Late upgrade: "Hawking Dividend" (black holes pay out over time)

**5) Reality Rebranding (Final Research Tree)**
| Research | Cost | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| Physics Renegotiation | 1B GU | Speed of light now "a suggestion" |
| Entropy Reversal Memo | 10B GU | Thermodynamics "restructured" |
| Causality Reassignment | 100B GU | Time now flows in "whatever direction is most great" |
| Ontological Supremacy | 1T GU | Reality itself is now a Greatness product |

#### Phase 5 Contradiction: GREATNESS vs. MEANING

The final joke.

You are converting the universe into Greatness. But the more Greatness exists, the less *anything* can be "great." If everything is optimized, nothing is special. If every star is converted, there's nothing left to be greater *than.*

The game expresses this mechanically:
- GU production increases exponentially
- But the "value" of each GU decreases logarithmically
- The player must run faster and faster to stay in place
- Reality Drift accelerates automatically
- The UI begins to break (intentionally)

**UI degradation in Phase 5:**
- Labels occasionally display wrong values
- The ticker reports events that contradict each other
- Buttons sometimes do the opposite of what they say
- The Legitimacy meter occasionally reads ">100%" or negative numbers
- The Nobel Score displays "N/A" then "∞" then "ERROR"

This is the game's final statement: *the machine you built to optimize everything has optimized away the ability to know what's true.*

#### Phase 5 Events (Examples)

- **"SCIENTISTS COMPLAIN: Reality no longer matches spreadsheets."**
  - Fund science: -1B GU, Reality Drift -10%
  - Fire scientists: +5B GU, Reality Drift +5%
  - Replace with Influencers: +2B GU, +1,000 Attention (somehow), Reality Drift +15%

- **"PROBE REPORT: Stars in Sector 7 already converted. By whom?"**
  - Investigate: Unlock "Mirror Universe" event chain
  - Claim credit: +10B GU, Reality Drift +3%
  - Deny stars ever existed: Reality Drift +20%, -5B GU but also +5B GU (net zero, but Drift accumulates)

- **"EXISTENTIAL QUERY: If everything is Great, is anything?"**
  - Increase production: +100B GU, Reality Drift +10%
  - Philosophical pause: -50B GU, Reality Drift -5%, +500 Legitimacy
  - Redefine "Great": Reality Drift +25%, all GU values scramble temporarily

#### THE ENDING

When 100% of reachable universe is converted:

**Screen 1:**
> *"THE UNIVERSE IS NOW GREAT."*

**Screen 2 (after 5 seconds):**
> *"..."*

**Screen 3 (after 5 seconds):**
> *"GREATNESS MUST BE MAINTAINED."*

**Screen 4:**
> *"ALERT: GREATNESS DECAY DETECTED.*
> *MAINTENANCE PROTOCOL: ACTIVE.*
> *OPTIMIZATION: REQUIRED.*
> *FOREVER."*

The game continues. The player can prestige (see below) or keep running the maintenance loop indefinitely.

---

## 5) PRESTIGE SYSTEM (NEW GAME+)

After completing Phase 5 (or at any phase transition), the player can **Prestige.**

**Prestige resets:**
- All currencies
- All progress
- All institutions
- All countries
- All space infrastructure

**Prestige keeps:**
- Prestige Points (PP), based on total GU earned
- Prestige Upgrades (permanent bonuses)
- Achievements
- Lifetime statistics

**Prestige Upgrades (examples):**

| Upgrade | Cost (PP) | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| Muscle Memory | 10 | Start with 10× click power |
| Deep State | 25 | Start Phase 2 with 3 institutions pre-captured |
| Old Alliances | 50 | Start Phase 3 with 2 countries at 50% Resistance |
| Retained Knowledge | 100 | All research 25% cheaper |
| Institutional Inertia | 200 | Legitimacy decays 50% slower |
| Orbital Inheritance | 500 | Start Phase 4 with basic launch infrastructure |
| Cosmic Memory | 1,000 | Start Phase 5 with 10 Dyson Swarms |
| The Eternal Engine | 5,000 | Greatness passively generates even when game is closed (×10 rate) |
| Ontological Anchor | 10,000 | Reality Drift maximum reduced by 20% |

---

## 6) OFFLINE / IDLE PROGRESSION

The game must work as an idle game. When the player is away:

**Offline earnings:**
- Base: 10% of active GpS
- Upgraded via research: up to 50%
- Prestige upgrade "The Eternal Engine": up to 100%

**Offline events:**
- Accumulate but don't resolve; presented as a queue when player returns
- Max queue: 10 events
- If Legitimacy would drop below 25% from accumulated events, the game auto-selects the least harmful option

**Return screen:**
> *"WHILE YOU WERE AWAY:*
> *+[X] Greatness generated*
> *[Y] events require your attention*
> *The Greatness Engine never sleeps."*

## 9) UI / UX DESIGN

**IMPORTANT: This is NOT a bare-bones text game like Universal Paperclips. This should look and feel like a polished, premium mobile game. Think: sleek dark command center with satisfying animations, glowing accents, smooth transitions, and tactile feedback. The kind of game where screenshots alone make people want to download it.**

### Main Tabs (Bottom Navigation)
| Tab | Unlocks | Content | Icon Idea |
|---|---|---|---|
| Dashboard | Always | Greatness + Legitimacy meters, main button, ticker | Flame / chart icon |
| Research | Phase 1 | Tech tree, upgrade purchases | Lab flask |
| Control | Phase 2 | Institution board, budget allocation | Crown / building |
| World | Phase 3 | Country map, fleet, Nobel meter | Globe |

### Visual Design Principles

1. **Premium dark UI.** Not flat/boring — use subtle gradients, soft glows, glassmorphism cards with translucent backgrounds. Think high-end dashboard, not terminal.

2. **Animated everything.** Numbers count up smoothly (not jump). Bars animate with easing. Buttons pulse when affordable. Cards slide in. Phase transitions are full-screen cinematic moments.

3. **Particle effects.** Click the main button → orange particles burst from it. Purchase an upgrade → satisfying sparkle. Phase transition → screen fills with particles that reform into new UI.

4. **Glowing orange accent.** The orange isn't just a color — it's a *glow*. Buttons have orange box-shadow glow. Active meters have orange gradient fills. The accent should feel warm and slightly ominous.

5. **Cards with depth.** Every upgrade, institution, country is a card with:
   - Subtle border gradient
   - Inner shadow for depth
   - Hover/tap state with lift effect
   - Status indicator (glow dot: green=owned, orange=affordable, grey=locked)

6. **Meters are beautiful.** Not plain HTML progress bars. Custom SVG or canvas:
   - Greatness: Wide bar with animated gradient (dark orange → bright orange → gold at high values)
   - Legitimacy: Changes color (green → yellow → red) with animated segments
   - Nobel: Gold gradient with shimmer effect at milestones
   - All meters have subtle background tick marks and numeric overlays

7. **Typography hierarchy.**
   - Large numbers: Bold monospace or tabular figures (so digits don't shift width)
   - Labels: Uppercase, letter-spaced, small, secondary color
   - Headlines/events: Serif or condensed sans for "newsfeed" feel
   - Everything legible at mobile sizes

8. **The ticker is a news chyron.** Styled like a TV news lower-third with:
   - Red/orange gradient background strip
   - White scrolling text
   - "BREAKING:" prefix in bold
   - Click/tap to expand into event modal

9. **Event modals are dramatic.** Full-screen overlays on mobile with:
   - Blurred background (backdrop-filter)
   - Headline in large type
   - Context in smaller type below
   - Choice buttons are large, full-width, with consequence previews
   - Color-coded: green for positive, red for negative, orange for mixed

10. **Phase transitions are cinematic.** Full-screen sequence:
    - Current UI fades to black
    - Text appears line by line (typewriter effect, 2-3 sec between lines)
    - Subtle particle/glow effects behind text
    - Final line triggers flash → new UI fades in
    - New tab appears with glow animation
    - Duration: ~15-20 seconds total

11. **Micro-interactions everywhere.**
    - Button press → scale down slightly → bounce back
    - Upgrade purchased → card flashes → counter increments with "+1" floating text
    - Achievement unlocked → toast slides down from top with gold accent
    - Legitimacy dropping → subtle red pulse on the bar
    - Reality Drift → UI elements occasionally glitch (CSS `transform: skew` briefly)

12. **Phase-specific visual evolution.** The UI itself evolves:
    - **Phase 1:** Clean, bright orange on dark. Startup energy.
    - **Phase 2:** More structured, grid-like. Government dashboard feel. Steel blue accents join orange.
    - **Phase 3:** Map visuals, military styling. Darker, more serious. Red accent joins for war elements.
    - **Phase 4:** Space blue-black backgrounds, star fields behind panels. Cosmic feel.
    - **Phase 5:** UI starts pristine then degrades with Reality Drift. Glitches, wrong colors, shifted elements.

### Responsive Breakpoints
| Breakpoint | Layout |
|---|---|
| < 480px | Mobile: single column, bottom tabs, full-width cards |
| 480–768px | Large mobile/small tablet: slightly wider cards, same layout |
| 768–1024px | Tablet: two-column for some sections (upgrades + stats side by side) |
| > 1024px | Desktop: multi-column dashboard, sidebar navigation instead of bottom tabs |

## 10) WRITING AND NAMING RULES

### Voice
Everything is written in one of three registers:
1. **Corporate press release** — "We are pleased to announce the successful completion of the Freedom Operation in the Sand Republic."
2. **Authoritarian euphemism** — "The institution has been realigned to better serve Greatness objectives."
3. **Absurd branding** — "The Orange Class Peace Cruiser: Because peace has never been this well-armed."

### Naming Templates
- "Orange Class ____"
- "Freedom ____"
- "Truth ____"
- "Greatness ____"
- "Historic ____"
- "Largest ____ Program"
- "Premium ____"
- "Heritage ____"
- "____ Optimization"
- "____ Realignment"

### Rules
- Never use real quotes or slogans verbatim
- Never reference real people by name
- Always parody, never imitate
- The word "Great" should appear in at least 30% of upgrade names
- Euphemisms should escalate: Phase 1 euphemisms are mild ("messaging"), Phase 5 euphemisms are cosmic ("ontological reassignment")
- **Satire through mechanics, not just text:** The game should make the player *do* the terrible thing, not just read about it. Defunding healthcare is a slider the player moves. Building GPU farms while hospitals close is a budget allocation the player makes. The horror is in the optimization.
- **References should be recognizable but deniable:** Frostheim is not Greenland. The Maple Federation is not Canada. The Refugee Engine is not any specific policy. But players will *know*.
- **Every cruel choice should be the "efficient" one:** The game is rigged so that the heartless option always generates more resources. The player learns that the system rewards cruelty. That's the satire.
- **Silicon Valley language for surveillance:** Data Centers are always described in tech-startup language. "AI-powered", "innovation", "disruption", "smart", "optimization". Every surveillance tool sounds like a TED talk.

## 11) ART AND AUDIO

### Visual Style
- **Premium dark UI with depth** — not flat. Subtle gradients, glassmorphism, soft shadows, glow effects
- Dark background with subtle noise texture (#1a1a1a base)
- Orange accent (#FF6600) used as glowing highlight throughout
- White text (#FFFFFF) with grey secondary (#888888)
- No character art (Orange Man is never shown — he's a *brand*, not a *person*)
- **Rich animations:** Smooth number counters, particle effects on actions, eased transitions on everything
- **Glassmorphic cards:** Translucent backgrounds, frosted edges, subtle border gradients
- Phase transition animations: full-screen cinematic sequences with typewriter text and particle effects
- **Satisfying feedback:** Every tap, purchase, and decision has visual + haptic + audio feedback
- Canvas or SVG for meters (not plain HTML bars) — animated gradients, shimmer effects, glow states

### Audio
- **Phase 1:** Satisfying UI clicks, cash register sounds, notification pings
- **Phase 2:** Muffled gavel sounds, bureaucratic shuffling, keyboard clatter
- **Phase 3:** Military drums (subtle), radio static, war room ambience
- **Phase 4:** Rocket rumble, space ambience, cosmic hum
- **Phase 5:** Cold sci-fi drone, data processing sounds, increasingly distorted audio (Reality Drift)
- **All phases:** Comedic "press conference sting" on major events

## 12) MONETIZATION (Ethical Approach)

### Model: Free-to-play with optional cosmetics and time-savers

**What you can buy:**
- **Ad removal** ($2.99 one-time)
- **Cosmetic dashboard themes** ($0.99 each): "Gold Plated," "War Room," "Void," "Retro Terminal"
- **Time skip tokens** ($0.99 for 5): Skip 1 hour of idle progress
- **"Executive Package"** ($4.99): All cosmetics + permanent 2× offline earnings

**What you CANNOT buy:**
- Greatness directly
- Legitimacy directly
- Upgrades or research
- Nobel Score
- Anything that skips gameplay

**Why this matters:** The game is a satire about systems that manipulate people. It would be hypocritical to manipulate players with predatory monetization. The game should be completable without spending anything.

## 16) FORMULA REFERENCE (For Balancing)

### Greatness per Second (GpS)
```
GpS = base_production × legitimacy_multiplier × phase_multiplier × prestige_bonus
```
Where:
- `legitimacy_multiplier` = 1.2 if Legitimacy > 80%, 1.0 if 50-80%, 0.7 if 25-49%, 0.4 if <25%
- `phase_multiplier` = 1 (Phase 1), 10 (Phase 2), 100 (Phase 3), 10,000 (Phase 4), 1,000,000 (Phase 5)
- `prestige_bonus` = 1 + (0.1 × prestige_level)

### Upgrade Cost Scaling
```
cost(n) = base_cost × 1.15^n
```
Standard incremental curve. 15% increase per purchase.

### Legitimacy Decay
```
decay_rate = 0.1% per second + (captured_institutions × 0.02%) + (active_wars × 0.5%) + (reality_drift × 0.1%)
```

### Nobel Score Diminishing Returns
```
effective_gain = base_gain × (1 / (1 + times_used × 0.1))
```
Each time you use a Nobel Score source, it becomes 10% less effective.

### Reality Drift Accumulation
```
drift_rate = (rebranding_events × 0.5%) + (scientist_firings × 1%) + (star_conversions × 1%) - (science_funding × 0.2%)
```
